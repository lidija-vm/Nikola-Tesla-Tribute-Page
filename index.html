  <div id="tribute-info">"Nikola Tesla (10 July 1856 – 7 January 1943) was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist best known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system. </br></br>

Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla studied engineering and physics in the 1870s without receiving a degree, gaining practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric power industry. In 1884 he emigrated to the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His alternating current (AC) induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company eventually marketed. </br></br>

Attempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla conducted a range of experiments with mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a wireless-controlled boat, one of the first-ever exhibited. Tesla became well known as an inventor and demonstrated his achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at his lab, and was noted for his showmanship at public lectures. Throughout the 1890s, Tesla pursued his ideas for wireless lighting and worldwide wireless electric power distribution in his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and Colorado Springs. In 1893, he made pronouncements on the possibility of wireless communication with his devices. Tesla tried to put these ideas to practical use in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project, an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter, but ran out of funding before he could complete it.

After Wardenclyffe, Tesla experimented with a series of inventions in the 1910s and 1920s with varying degrees of success. Having spent most of his money, Tesla lived in a series of New York hotels, leaving behind unpaid bills. He died in New York City in January 1943. Tesla's work fell into relative obscurity following his death, until 1960, when the General Conference on Weights and Measures named the SI unit of magnetic flux density the tesla in his honor.There has been a resurgence in popular interest in Tesla since the 1990s."</div>

  <h2>Biography of Nikola Tesla</h2>
  <p>He was born on July 10, 1856 in Smiljan, in the former Military Border of the Austrian Empire. Tesla's father's name was Milutin and he was an Orthodox priest. He loved to read and had a rich library in which the scientist spent his childhood and learned foreign languages. During his life he spoke: Serbian, English, German, Italian, French, Czech, Hungarian, Latin and Slovenian. Her mother's name was Đuka and she was a hard-working woman from whom Nikola inherited a penchant for research life. The mother, unlike the father, experienced all the glory of her son. He had one brother, Dane, and three sisters: Angelina, Milka and Marica. It was named after his paternal grandfather. He was baptized in the Serbian Orthodox Church of St. Peter and Paul in Smiljan.<br/></br>
He finished the first grade in his hometown in a German primary school, and he attended the other three grades and lower real high school in Gospić, where the family moved after the accident in which Tesla's brother Dane died. He was believed to be more capable and intelligent than Nikola. He enrolled in the High Real High School in Karlovac, and he was tormented by the fact that he was expected to continue the family tradition and become a priest. He graduated on July 24, 1873, in a group of seven students.</br></br>
He went to Gospić for the holidays and fell ill with cholera. He was very ill and then he admitted to his father that he would like to study technique. His father promised him that he would go to the best technical school, after which he recovered. He spent some time in the village with his uncle, uncle Tomo Mandić, where he gathered strength for the upcoming efforts.

<ul>
  <li> 
    <strong>1875</strong>
    He enrolled at the Polytechnic School in Graz. He was interested in the natural sciences and spent all his free time studying. He slept four hours a day and read a large number of books, many of which he knew by heart.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>1878</strong> - He started working as an assistant engineer in Maribor. He indulged in gambling, and his father barely found him and brought him home. He could not find an explanation for his son's behavior, so he passed away the following year. Tesla worked briefly at the Gospić Real Gymnasium and enrolled at a university in Prague to fulfill his father's wish. However, he was aware of the sacrifice his family was making, which is why he left his studies.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>1881</strong> - He moved to Budapest and was the chief telephone technician at the American Telephone Company. He invented a device that some consider to be a telephone amplifier and some to be the first speaker.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>1882</strong> - He got a job in Paris at Edison's Continental Society. He worked as an engineer in the field of electrical equipment improvement. Having been noticed, he was recommended to Edison, who was then considered the hero of electricity. He then invented the rotating magnetic field and the inductive motor which he later constructed. He came to Gospić a few hours before his mother's death. Since he was attached to her, it hit him hard, so he recovered for three weeks in the village of Tomingaj, her birthplace.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>1884</strong> - Edison hired Tesla in his laboratory in New York. He soon progressed and was offered to redesign Edison's DC generator.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>1886</strong> - Founded the company "Tesla Electric Light & Manufacturing". Investors did not agree to use the AC motor, which is why they denied him financial assistance.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>1887</strong> - He worked as an ordinary worker to feed himself and raise money to construct the first brushless AC electric motor. Westinghouse wanted to buy his patents in this field. He developed the principles of Tesla's (his) coil and, with Westinghouse engineers, practically applied his inventions.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>1891</strong> - He became an American citizen. He had a new lab on Houston Street and showed a fluorescent light bulb that glows without wires.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>1892</strong> - He applied for the first patent in the field of multiphase currents. For the next two years, he was vice president of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers. He gave lectures and promoted his ideas throughout Europe. That was the last time he visited Belgrade and his homeland. On that occasion, he received the Order of Saint Sava II class.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>1893</strong> - He began to study high-frequency alternating currents. It produced an alternating current of one million volts with the help of Tesla's coil. In St. Louis, he showed a broadcast similar to radio communication.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>1895</strong> - He was awarded the Order of Independence of Montenegro.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>1897</strong> - He showed the US Army a model of a radio-controlled ship. He talked about robotics and continued to research in the field of wireless signal and energy transmission. He was a key man in the construction of the first hydroelectric power plant at Niagara Falls, and on that occasion he spoke publicly about his research. However, they are a mystery because wireless power transmission has not been used. Tesla wanted to use the upper layers of the globe to transfer energy from one end of the world to the other.
  </li>
 <li>
    <strong>1898</strong> - The scientist invented an electric lighter or spark plug for gasoline engines with internal combustion.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>1899</strong> - He moved to Colorado Springs where he continued his research. His experiments became the subject of urban legends. In his laboratory, he proved that the Earth is a conductor and artificially caused lightning. He studied atmospheric electricity and claimed to have recorded radio signals of extraterrestrial origin. Although the scientific community rejected this data, Tesla tried for a long time to send a signal to Mars.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>1900</strong> - He left Colorado Springs, and his lab was demolished because he was in debt. He has prepared for the next project: the construction of a wireless power transmission plant.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>1904</strong> - The U.S. Patent Office granted the radio patent to Guillermo Marconi. Then Tesla started fighting to get that patent back.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>1906</strong> - It publicly unveiled its 200-horsepower bladeless turbines at 16,000 rpm.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>1909</strong> - Marconi received the Nobel Prize for the discovery of radio. Six years later, Tesla sued him and sought judicial protection for his rights to the radio. Due to the war, he stopped receiving funds from his European patents. In 1916, he went bankrupt because he had too many expenses.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>1917</strong> - He built the Telefunken wireless station on Long Island, but the US Navy demolished it because German spies could have abused it. He became obsessed with number three and was irrationally afraid of germs. Little was known about the disorder at the time, so many thought it was insanity.
  </li>
  <li>Tesla lived in the apartment of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, where he made a debt of 20,000 dollars. The owner of the hotel took ownership of Wardenclyffe and demolished the tower so that he could sell the plots.</li>
<li>In the same year, Tesla was awarded the Edison Medal and set the principles regarding the frequency and power level of the first primitive radar.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>1919</strong> - He published his autobiography in the form of articles in the magazine "Electrical Experimenter".
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>1926</strong> - He was awarded the Order of Saint Sava I class, Kingdom of SCS.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>1928</strong> - Tesla was granted the latest patent in the field of air transport. He constructed the first spacecraft with vertical takeoff and landing.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>1931</strong> - For his seventy-fifth birthday, he found himself on the cover of Time magazine. He received the Order of the Yugoslav Crown.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>1934</strong> - He thanked Mihajlo Pupin because he believed that American companies must create a fund to provide him with a carefree old age. Tesla refused, and accepted only a modest pension from the Yugoslav government. He continued to do research in accordance with his abilities and often fed the pigeons.
  </li>
  <li> 
    <strong>1936</strong> - He was awarded the Order of the White Eagle Class I of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>1937</strong> - He stated that he completed a unique field theory, but no one took him seriously. He received a medal from the University of Paris and the Order of the White Lion I class, Czechoslovakia. At that time, his friends Robert Underwood Johnson and Richmond Pearson Hobson passed away, which hit him hard. In the same year, he was run over by a taxi, which further endangered his fragile health.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>1939</strong> - He was awarded the medal of the University of St. Clement in Sofia.
  </li>
  <li>Tesla se povukao iz javnog života, a jedino su ga posećivali sestrić Sava Kosanović i par prijatelja. Napravio je izuzetak 1942. godine kada je kralj Petar II Karađorđević došao u njegov apartman da ga upozna.</li>
  <li>On January 5, 1943, he called the US Department of War and offered to reveal the secret of his super weapon. The officer he was talking to thought he was crazy, so he didn't take him seriously. Two days later, Tesla died at the New Yorker Hotel. It was noted that the cause of death was cardiac thrombosis, and the time was 22 hours and 30 minutes.</li>
  <li>On January 12, in the church of St. Jovan Bogoslov gathered two thousand people in Manhattan and sent him to eternal rest. Violinist Zlatko Balokovic, a scientist's friend, played at the funeral. He first performed the composition "Ave Maria", and then "Tamo daleko".
</li>
  <li>
    <strong>1943</strong> - The US Supreme Court returned Tesla's right to invent radio. The FBI confiscated all his property and documents from the Immigration Service and declared it a top secret.
  </li>
  <li>
    The scientist's family fought for that property, and his nephew Sava managed to regain a small part that is in the Nikola Tesla Museum in Belgrade. Since 1957, the remains of this great man have also been in the museum, in an urn that has a spherical shape.
  </li>
  <li>His name was introduced to the House of Famous Inventors of America and eight countries celebrate his birthday as a national holiday.
  </li>
  <li>Nikola Tesla was awarded honorary doctorates: Technical Schools Vienna, Prague, Graz and Brno, Universities in Belgrade, Zagreb, Sofia, Poitiers, Paris and Grenoble, and the Polytechnic School in Bucharest.

<h3>One of Tesla's many quotes: </h3>
<p>"If I am lucky enough to realize at least some of my ideas, it will be a charity for all of humanity. If my hopes are fulfilled, my sweetest thought will be that it is the work of a Serb."
